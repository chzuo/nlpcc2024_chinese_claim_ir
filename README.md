# From Claim to Evidence: Verifying Chinese Health Claims with Medical Literature
## Accepted at NLPCC 2024

This repository contains the dataset for the [paper](), where we present a bilingual query-based biomedical information retrieval task across two vastly different genres â€“ Chinese newswire and English research literature. For this task, we developed a specialized IR dataset. It was constructed in two stages: first, we created a gold-standard dataset, which was then expanded into a silver-standard corpus.
